Hello,
I am a UX designer and researcher.

Currently, I am studying Design (master's degree) at UW, Seattle.

 

My dream is that changing the world through good design. This is possible because the design makes our everyday lives (health, economy, and education, etc) better and it is able to create a strong social impact. 

 

So, I enjoy thinking about the ways that I could make the world better by crossing any boundaries of different fields and thinking systemically.
